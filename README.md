# Jupyter Stacks - Datascience Image

This repository contains a Dockerfile that simply pulls from the
[Jupyter Stacks Datascience Image](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-datascience-notebook).
It is meant to prototype Binder functionality that separates the environment
repository from the content repository.
